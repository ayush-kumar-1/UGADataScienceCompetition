## EDA & Preprocessing
There are missing values in the dataset. We have to analyze if state makes a difference. 
Dummy variables. Variable Selection is a must. 

Imputation. 

## Logistic Regression 
Variable Selection during logistic regression. Implementing an income cap. 

Decision Rule - using entropy on the validation dataset. 

## Feed Forward Neural Network
We will be using Tensorflow and Keras to build our nueral networks.
